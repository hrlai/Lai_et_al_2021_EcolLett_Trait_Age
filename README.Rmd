# Preamble

Welcome! This is a repository for the data and models in our paper:

> Lai H. R., Craven D., Hall, J. S., Hui F. K. C., van Breugel, M. (2021) Successional syndromes of saplings in tropical secondary forests emerge from environment-dependent trait−demography relationships. *Ecology Letters*.

# Usage 

You could either [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) our GitHub repository or, if you're unfamiliar with GitHub, download the [released zip file](https://github.com/hrlai/Lai_et_al_2021_EcolLett_Trait_Age/releases).

The `R` script `R/reproducibility.R` is basically all you need to extract data or examine model outputs from the two models: the recruitment model `data/recruitment_model.rds` and the mortality model `data/mortality_model.rds`. Please see the script for instructions. The rest of the scripts in the `R` folder are axillary scripts to mainly to reproduce figures.
